    "description": "⚠️ ADRENALINE is currently closed. We have a donations page open, for anyone interested in supporting our vision.\nDonating may reward you with additional benefits on other platforms! Join our community server to learn more.\n\nFAQ\nQ: Why is ADRENALINE closed?\nA: ADRENALINE was open for a temporary playtest. It allowed us to learn more about the market, our community, and what we can refine going forwards. Don't worry, we'll reopen soon!\n\nQ: Why can't ADRENALINE remain open?\nA: If we kept the game open, we would not be able to roll out updates consistently enough to retain our playerbase. Essentially, ADRENALINE needs some more time in the oven before we can take on a recurring-update release model. \n\nQ: Where can I keep up with ADRENALINE's development?\nA: We have a community server where we interact with our followers, share development progress and hang out! If you're interested, it is listed on this very experience page.\n\nAs we receive more questions, we will expand upon this FAQ. ♥️"
